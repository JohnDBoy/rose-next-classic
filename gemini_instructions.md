# Instructions for File Review and Tracking

1. **File Review in Chunks**  
   Due to output token limitations, review files in smaller, manageable sections. For each chunk, focus on key files and record their relevance.

2. **Use `gemini_gameplan.md` for Organization**  
   Plan AND update the review process using `gemini_gameplan.md`. Break the task into logical stages (e.g., scan folders or specific types of files first).

3. **Track Progress in `gemini_memory.md`**  
   Update `gemini_memory.md` with each completed chunk. This will help you avoid revisiting already processed files and allow for a smooth, incremental approach.

4. **Prioritize Important Files**  
   Focus on files that are important for future development. These might include code files, documentation, configuration files, etc. Skip files with minimal relevance.

5. **Ignore "assets - copy" Folder**  
   Exclude the "assets - copy" folder entirely from the review.

6. **Log Findings in `gemini_files.md`**  
   For each important file, document the following in `gemini_files.md`:
   
   - **File Name**  
   - **Type (code, config, doc, etc.)**  
   - **Relevance to Project**  
   - **Any key insights or actions needed**

   7. **Sections withing the overall project can be found in `gemini_projects.md`**
   Major sections of this project are listed in `gemini_projects.md`
